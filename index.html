        <p>Greetings everyone. Thank you for visiting my portifolio. I am an upcoming webdeveloper, learning this skill very passionately and with lot of excitement as this keeps on challenging me and my abilities. Please have a look at the two projects I've made as a beginner to webdev. </p>
        <h2><a href="./public/movie-ranking.html">Movie Ranking:</a></h2>
        <p>This is the very first project I've done while taking my first steps in webdevelopment. I am very excited by the way it turned out and Can't wait for you to check on it. I've used multi-webpages to make the website more attractive. Since these are my initial steps, the above mentioned link directs you to the second webpage connected in it and the below displayed attachment is how the webpage looks.</p>
        <img src=".//assets/images/Movie Ranking.png" height="300px" width="400px"/>
        <h2><a href="./public/birthday-invite.html">Birthday Invitation:</a></h2>
        <p>This is the second project I've made using the basics in HTML. Unlike the first project, I've learnt implementation of image tags in this project. The above mentioned link directs you to that webpage and the below displayed attachment is how the webpage looks like. </p>
        <img src="birthday-invite.png" height="300px">
        <p>These websites are of a basic structure. I'll update each and every project I prepare from now and make this webpage into a full fledged website.</p><hr>
